## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.x (we recommend 18.17.0)
- npm >= 9.x or yarn >= 1.22.x
- Git >= 2.x
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/janujanjida/LearnChain.git
cd LearnChain
npm install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Code Coverage

```bash
npm run coverage
```

### Linting

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

## Coding Standards

### Solidity

- Follow Solidity style guide
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts when possible
- Add NatSpec comments for all public functions
- Include security considerations

Example:
```solidity
/**
 * @notice Creates a new learning task
 * @dev Requires TASK_CREATOR_ROLE
 * @param metadataURI IPFS URI containing task details
 * @return taskId Unique identifier for the created task
 */
function createTask(string memory metadataURI) external returns (uint256 taskId) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features
- Follow Airbnb style guide
- Add JSDoc comments for functions
- Use meaningful variable names

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain >90% code coverage
- Include edge cases
- Test both happy and error paths

Example:
```javascript
describe("TaskManager", function () {
  it("Should create a task with valid parameters", async function () {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it("Should fail when creating task without required role", async function () {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits format:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Test additions or changes
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `style:` Formatting changes
